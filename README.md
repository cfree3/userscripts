Userscripts
===========

> *NOTE:* This repository is no longer maintained!

This repo is a collection of special JavaScript scripts (["userscripts"][userscripts]) that can be
run from within your browser. In [Firefox][firefox], this can be accomplished with the
[Greasemonkey][greasemonkey] extension. [Chromium][chromium] and [Google Chrome][chrome] support
these scripts natively (as extensions).

Getting the scripts...
----------------------
The manner in which you should install one of these scripts depends on your browser/extension.
With Greasemonkey, go to the "raw" view of the script, and the extension (if enabled) should
prompt you to install.

Credit
------
Chances are, most of the code in my scripts was pulled from various places around the Internet.
I've tried to give general credits in the individual scripts.

License?
--------
These userscripts are released under the MIT license (see `LICENSE.md`).

DISCLAIMER
----------
I give no guarantees that any of these scripts is secure or will work at all in your environment.
Read the source if you care, and &ndash; as always &ndash; _use at your own risk_.
