Userscripts
===========
This repo is a collection of special JavaScript scripts (["userscripts"](https://userscripts.org))
that can be run from within your browser. In [Firefox](http://www.firefox.com), this can be
accomplished with the [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net) extension.

Getting the scripts...
----------------------
The manner in which you should install one of these scripts depends on your browser/extension.
With Greasemonkey, go to the "raw" view of the script, and the extension (if enabled) should
prompt you to install.

Credit
------
Chances are, most of the code in my scripts was pulled from various places around the Internet.
I've tried to give general credits in the individual scripts.

License?
--------
You may use and hack on these scripts yourself; however, if you redistribute any of this work, you
must:

*  Include it in an _open-source_ context.
*  Give credit to me (Curtis Free) as the creator of the script(s) and &ndash; more important &ndash; retain
   all existing references/credits.
*  [Let me know!](&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#99;&#102;&#64;&#99;&#117;&#114;&#116;&#105;&#115;&#102;&#114;&#101;&#101;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;)

If you find one of my scripts useful, I'd [like to know](&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#99;&#102;&#64;&#99;&#117;&#114;&#116;&#105;&#115;&#102;&#114;&#101;&#101;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;).

DISCLAIMER
----------
I give no guarantees that any of these scripts is secure or will work at all in your environment.
Read the source if you care, and &ndash; as always &ndash; _use at your own risk_.

Bugs
----
This is a "works-for-me-maybe" project: I do not guarantee that any bugfixing will occur.
<acronym title="For Your Information">FYI</acronym>, I created/tested these scripts using Firefox 4
and Greasemonkey on <a href="https://www.archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a>.
