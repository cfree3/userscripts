Userscripts
===========
This repo is a collection of special JavaScript scripts (["userscripts"][userscripts]) that can be
run from within your browser. In [Firefox][firefox], this can be accomplished with the
[Greasemonkey][greasemonkey] extension. [Chromium][chromium] and [Google Chrome][chrome] support
these scripts natively (as extensions).

Getting the scripts...
----------------------
The manner in which you should install one of these scripts depends on your browser/extension.
With Greasemonkey, go to the "raw" view of the script, and the extension (if enabled) should
prompt you to install.

Credit
------
Chances are, most of the code in my scripts was pulled from various places around the Internet.
I've tried to give general credits in the individual scripts.

License?
--------
You may use and hack on these scripts yourself; however, if you redistribute any of this work, you
must:

  *  Include it in an _open-source_ context.
  *  Give credit to me (Curtis Free) as the creator of the script(s) and &ndash; more important
     &ndash; retain all existing references/credits.
  *  [Let me know!][email]

If you find one of my scripts useful, I'd [like to know][email].

DISCLAIMER
----------
I give no guarantees that any of these scripts is secure or will work at all in your environment.
Read the source if you care, and &ndash; as always &ndash; _use at your own risk_.

Bugs
----
This is a "works-for-me-maybe" project: I do not guarantee that any bugfixing will occur.
FYI, I created/tested these scripts using Firefox 4 and Greasemonkey on [Arch Linux][arch].
